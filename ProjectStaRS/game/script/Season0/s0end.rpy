    "I couldn't shake the feeling that… something about this whole situation felt fishy to me. It seemed like the producer was trying to warn me about something grave."

    "I've heard stories about how difficult it was to become an idol. It was incredibly demanding, and dangerous at that. With long work hours and stalker threats, it was probably wisest not to poke that hornet's nest."

    s "I'll… rethink it and get back to you. Thank you for the opportunity."

    "..."

    "A moment of silence washed over us as Tsuki seemed to be deliberating a response."

    #[Tsuki]
    t "... I see, very well then. It sounds to me that you've already made the right choice, but either way, please get back to me by the end of the month."

    "Her response was cryptic, but it was almost a relief to hear her professional voice again. My finger hovered over the red button as I prepared to end the call."

    #[Seika]
    s "Mhm, thank you again! Goodbye!"

    #[Tsuki]
    t "Goodbye."

    #[-]
    "The call ended, and everything was silent again. I let go of the breath I didn't even know I was holding."

    "I glanced over at my bed, where my plushies had scattered all around the floor."
    
    "Time to pick everything up."

    "..."

    "I decided to retake the medical school exam."

    "For the next few months, I threw myself into my studies, cooping myself up in my room for hours on end."
    
    "The whole process was grueling, and the concepts were really difficult, but putting my all into this… just felt right." 

    "Fortunately, I passed. Funnily enough, practicing nonstop for my audition made me a better student. Thanks again, Natsuha."

    "Ah. Speaking of, I realized a bit late that I'd forgotten to get back to the producer about my decision."
    
    "Although, she never got back to me in the end, so I guess she must've found a replacement for me."

    "Anyways, seeing all the news and controversy about idols recently has made me rather glad I didn't take that leap of faith."
    
    "Really feels like I dodged a bullet there, don't you think?"

    ygp "But, Dr. Kawasaki… Don't you ever long to be on one of those big stages, surrounded by lights and people?"

    ygp "It all seems so lovely..."

    #[Seika]
    s "Maybe so, but watching them from the comfort of your own home, supporting the dreams of your beloved idols on their road to the top… Isn't that its own joy?"

    s "Besides, seeing the smiles of my patients is the greatest joy of them all."

    "I smile warmly at Kaori's expression, her eyes marveling at the screen by her bedside with childlike wonder."
    
    "I chuckle to myself, watching as my words went in one ear and out the next."

    "I vividly remember having the same experience when I saw an idol perform live for the first time."
    
    "That day, 7 years ago, was also when I had my very first dream. A short-lived one, certainly, but a dream nonetheless."

    "As the song ends, Kaori looks at me with a face of awe, pointing to the TV screen where Natsuha was bowing to her fans."

    #[Kaori]
    kaori "So… you know her… as a friend?"

    #[Seika]
    s "Know her? Yes, I know her. We still talk… every so often, at least."

    s "Hah, I've known for a long time that Natsuha was better suited for this kind of thing than me. And look, my intuition was right – she's the #1 idol in Japan, after all!"

    #[-]
    "I cross my arms triumphantly to elicit a giggle from my patient, causing my own heart to swell in happiness."

    "Laughter truly is the best medicine; the sound my patients make when they laugh, the way the muscles around their eyes contract – I've memorized them all."
    
    "This is my dream job, and no amount of what-if-buts can ever change that."

    "Although truth be told, I was surprised when I first heard that Natsuha had gone through with joining Horizon Productions, even when she knew I had declined the offer."

    "A selfish part of me had thought she was doing it all for my sake, but it was soon clear to me that she had some dreams of her own."
    
    "I almost felt betrayed at first, despite the fact that I was the one who'd brought her into it to begin with."

    "Ah, but seeing where she is now, the image of her dazzling smile ingrained into the mind of every Japanese citizen, I'm certain that I'm proud of how far she's come."

    #[Kaori]
    kaori "D-Dr. Kawasaki? Are you crying…?"

    #[-]
    "Still, as I watch my friend begin her next song, I can't help but feel like I missed out on something big."
